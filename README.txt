I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

Run the inter class and enjoy my game!

If you find out that keyboard control does not work, try to press tab to switch the focus. Yet under normal situation, both keypresses and mouseCLICKED method should work and control mario’s motion. 

Basic rules are as below:

In level2, you will run through a grassland, but other features are almost the same.
You can pause the game at anytime and the time will not keep moving until you return back to the game.

Every time you quit a round, a new map will be generated.

Also notice probably due to the complicated features I added into the game, there may be some small delay, but again I add a hardcoded delay on the time the game start, so the game usually start after the picture and all components show up.

This is the rule for counting the total points. I offer a 3600s time as basic, so if you spend less than 3600s, you are going to be rewarded on your points, and if you spend more, you will get penalized. Each coin worth 10 points, and if you bump into the monster, you lose one blood. But if you kick it, which means you approaches the monster from top, you get 50 points of reward.

The powerUp worth 200 points, and your health worth a certain amount of points as well. Those will be summarized at the end of the game.

I think this is a wonderful game and probably the one I spent most of the time. Since I submit it such early and do so many features such as sound, walking players(the mario is not a picture now! it is, well, three changing pictures) and customize gun, random wall, I hope I deserve the extra points even though I don’t take a look at the requirement of the extra credit lol.

Hope you enjoy the game!

All other rules are the same as the prompt required, and they should work properly.

All of the classes should compile/execute normally.
